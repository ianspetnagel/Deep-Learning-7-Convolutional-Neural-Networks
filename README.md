# Deep-Learning-7-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

Dataset is CIFAR-10.
For this project I am are programming Deep Convolutional Neural Networks in the PyTorch environment. We will be testing the accuracy on about 10K images.


*Running 100 Epochs and getting predictions*

Now I am programming resnet-50 for the CIFAR 10 classification. This will let me skip some connections, thus many CNN layers can be used without causing vanishing gradients.

*Accuracy is 84.85*
