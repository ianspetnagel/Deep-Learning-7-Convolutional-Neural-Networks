# Deep-Learning-7-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

This project focuses on using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
Approximately 10,000 images are used for testing accuracy. The model undergoes training for 100 epochs, after which predictions are made. 

Specifically, a ResNet-50 architecture is programmed for CIFAR-10 classification, allowing for the utilization of many CNN layers without encountering vanishing gradients. The achieved accuracy stands at 84.85%.

Now I am programming resnet-50 for the CIFAR 10 classification. This will let me skip some connections, thus many CNN layers can be used without causing vanishing gradients.

*Accuracy is 84.85%*
